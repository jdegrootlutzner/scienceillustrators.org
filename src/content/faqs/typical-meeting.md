question: "What does a typical meeting look like?"
order: 3
---
Our meetings typically include:

- A brief introduction and welcome for new members (15 minutes)
- A short demonstration or tutorial on a specific visualization technique or tool (30 minutes)
- Hands-on workshop time where members can work on their own projects with support from peers (45 minutes)

Some meetings feature guest speakers or focus on specific themes. We also occasionally organize special events, like field trips to exhibitions or collaborative projects.
